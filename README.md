## Overview
checkmake is an experimental tool for linting and checking Makefiles. It may
not do what you want it to.

## Usage

```
% checkmake Makefile

% checkmake --help
checkmake.

Usage:
checkmake [--debug|--config=<configPath>] <makefile>
checkmake -h | --help
checkmake --version

Options:
-h --help               Show this screen.
--version               Show version.
--debug                 Enable debug mode
--config=<configPath>   Configuration file to read
--list-rules            List registered rules

% checkmake fixtures/missing_phony.make

      RULE                 DESCRIPTION             LINE NUMBER

  minphony        Missing required phony target    0
                  "all"
  minphony        Missing required phony target    0
                  "test"
  phonydeclared   Target "all" should be           18
                  declared PHONY.

```

## Docker usage
Build the image, or pull it:
```sh
docker build --build-arg BUILDER_NAME="Your Name" --build-arg BUILDER_EMAIL="your.name@example.com" . -t checker
```

Then run it with your Makefile attached, below is an example of it assuming the Makefile is in your current working directory:
```sh
docker run -v $(pwd)/Makefile:/Makefile checker
```

## Installation

### Requirements
The [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) document converter utility is required to run checkmate. You can find out if you have it via `which pandoc`. [Install pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) if the command was not found.

### Packages
There are packages for linux up [on packagecloud.io](https://packagecloud.io/mrtazz/checkmake) or build it yourself with the steps below.

### Build
To build checkmake you will need to have [golang](https://golang.org/) installed. Once you have Go installed, you can simply clone the repo and build the binary and man page yourself with the following commands.

```
go get github.com/mrtazz/checkmake
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/mrtazz/checkmake
make
```

## Inspiration
This is totally inspired by an idea by [Dan
